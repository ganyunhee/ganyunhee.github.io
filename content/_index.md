Hi, I'm Eunice! I am an undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science and Engineering in Sogang University. I aspire to become a multidisciplinary developer or designer adept in Front End/Web Development as well as UI/UX & Motion Graphics Design. This is a personal blog I created for life, learning, and programming documentation.
Feel free to explore!
